#### Similar Image search using K-means clustering in Hadoop
* Given an image, the system returns k closest similar images for a database of 1 million images from Flickr.
* Used feature vectors obtained from VGG-16 network to cluster 1 million images for product quantization.
* Reduced distance computations to 0.4% of original using product quantization.
* Searches for upto top 20 images in 1 sec.
* Transformed and filtered data and implemented distributed k means clustering using Map Reduce in Hadoop.

#### Visualising Convolutional Neural Networks
* Visualized the effect of every filter on the input pixel space of a ConvNet using deconvolutional architecture.
* Created a custom CIFAR-100 image classifier with 67% accuracy for testing the deconvolutional net. 
* Implemented un-maxpooling layers and deconvolutional layers based on Matthew Zeiler’s 2010 CVPR paper on Deconvolutional Nets and 2013 paper on Visualizing Neural Networks.

####  <a href ="https://github.com/atharvajakkanwar/cv-pose-estimation"> Camera pose estimation using multiple images </a>
* This application visualises the camera position and orientation in the real world. As inputs you need to give in an image whose camera location we need to estimate, the original image and its dimensions.
* Uses pinhole camera model's intrinc matrix from photogammetry

<hr>
#### <a href ="https://github.com/atharvajakkanwar/smart-qube"> IoT Cube </a>
* Successfully designed and prototyped a smart IoT hub for wireless controlling of connected devices using motion gestures.
* Used Arduino Nano as the embedded system on the device with accelerometers as actuators.
* Accelerometer readings are sent to a central hub to trigger API calls to IFTTT server to controll smart lights and other devices.
* Fabricated and 3d printed the casing for the cube.
