I am a grad student currently pursuing a Masters degree in Computer Science from Northeastern University Seattle, with interests in Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Web Services. Physical computing and Internet of Things also entice me.

While not thinking about tech, I Iike to sketch or paint and a hike or two is what I look forward to.
